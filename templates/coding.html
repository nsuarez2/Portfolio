					<h3>Everyone's music. One queue.</h3>
					<p><a target="_blank" href="http://oneq.us">One Queue</a> is built on the idea of a shared music playlist, specifically with small social gatherings in mind. Instead of having one person's phone be passed around, it allows party goers to add music to the unified queue, right from their own device. All music is played from the host's (the first person to visit <a target="_blank" href="http://oneq.us">oneq.us</a>) device, and they are the only one required to have a Spotify account whether it be a free or premium one.</p>
